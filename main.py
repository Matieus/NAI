Conclusions:
(Jakub)
    The first problem I encountered was that air molecules cannot have a value of 0.0.
    Must be at least 0.1, otherwise the algorithm sets errors.

    Unfortunately the API was not conducive to the topic of fuzzy logic.
    You need to make a result for each air particle and then check the air quality.

    The worst idea, but still accepted, was to create rules for every possible scheme.
    But I decided to do it in another way
